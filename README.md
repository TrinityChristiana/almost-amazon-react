## Tuesday Night
- When we click an author, we should see all the Books that were written by that author
- When we DELETE an author also delete all books!
  - This one is a little tricky because we also need to delete all of the Books that the author has written as well as the author (the relationship)
  - Look at the author ID and index on it for Books. Get an object that holds all that author's books Delete them all
